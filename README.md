# Note-Taker


This is an application that is used to write, save, and delete notes. This application will use an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.We set the port, all the routs amd middleware.Seperated the code in different files and connected them to each other.

I created  two folders for routes, such as:apiroutes and html routs.Also the json file for notes.When we get notes it returns notes.html file.

For posting the new note I created the read file in the post that was using my notes and push everything wright before the write file.

As a bonus I also  deleting the notes 

AS a user, you are  able to write,save and delete notes,
so that you can organize your thoughts and keep track of tasks you need to complete.
